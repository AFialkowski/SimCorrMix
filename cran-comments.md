## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Written the package names in single quotes in description in DESCRIPTION file.

* Added '()' behind function names in description in DESCRIPTION file.

* Added examples in main function files that can be tested which are less than 5 sec each.
  
## Test environments
* local OS 'Windows 10' install, 'R 3.4.3'
* 'win-builder' (devel and release)
* 'CentOS', 'R 3.4.1'

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

This is a new package.

## Downstream dependencies

I have also run R CMD check on downstream dependencies of SimCorrMix. 
All packages that I could install passed.
