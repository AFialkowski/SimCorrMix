Description: Generate continuous (normal, non-normal, or mixture distributions), binary, ordinal, 
    and count (regular or zero-inflated, Poisson or Negative Binomial) variables with a specified 
    correlation matrix, or one continuous variable with a mixture distribution.  This package can 
    be used to simulate data sets that mimic real-world clinical or genetic data sets (i.e., 
    plasmodes, as in Vaughan et al., 2009 <DOI:10.1016/j.csda.2008.02.032>).  The methods 
    extend those found in the SimMultiCorrData R package.  Standard normal variables with an 
    imposed intermediate correlation matrix are transformed to generate the desired distributions.  
    Continuous variables are simulated using either Fleishman (1978)'s third order 
    <DOI:10.1007/BF02293811> or Headrick (2002)'s fifth order 
    <DOI:10.1016/S0167-9473(02)00072-5> polynomial transformation method (the power method 
    transformation, PMT).  Non-mixture distributions require the user to specify mean, variance, 
    skewness, standardized kurtosis, and standardized fifth and sixth cumulants.  Mixture 
    distributions require these inputs for the component distributions plus the mixing 
    probabilities.  Simulation occurs at the component level for continuous mixture 
    distributions.  The target correlation matrix is specified in terms of correlations with 
    components of continuous mixture variables.  However, the package provides functions to 
    determine expected correlations with continuous mixture variables given target correlations 
    with the components. Binary and ordinal variables are simulated using a modification of 
    package GenOrd's ordsample function.  Count variables are simulated using the inverse CDF 
    method.  There are two simulation pathways which calculate intermediate correlations 
    involving count variables differently.  Correlation Method 1 adapts Yahav and Shmueli's 
    2012 method <DOI:10.1002/asmb.901>.  Correlation Method 2 adapts Barbiero and Ferrari's 
    2015 modification of the GenOrd package <DOI:10.1002/asmb.2072>.  The optional error loop 
    may be used to improve the accuracy of the final correlation matrix.  The package also 
    contains functions to calculate the standardized cumulants of continuous mixture 
    distributions, check parameter inputs, calculate feasible correlation boundaries, and 
    plot simulated variables.
